    <h2 class='title-one'>My Mother, Perette</h2>
  <p> My mother has always been there for me growing up and is still the person I lean at my current age. She is a beautiful, strong, thoughtful, and courageous person. Growing up, I wasn't the easiest child to deal with, but she showed patience and love. She moved to the United States from Haiti at the age of 28 and persevered through life's obstacles of being new to this country. My mother always shares that there is no way she would be where she is or how she is if it was not for God's goodness.</p>
